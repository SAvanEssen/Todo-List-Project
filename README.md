# Todo-List-Project
Project related to Udemy Course by Colt Steele as part of the CodeGorilla Bootcamp in Groningen.
This is just my first attempt to use Git to create a repository on Github, this will not be a work in progress. 
The real Todo List Project will be in a new repository and will be updated as knowledge increases throughout the bootcamp.
